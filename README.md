# Voicify Landing Page

This project is a redesign of the Voicify homepage, crafted to match the specifications outlined in the corresponding Figma design file provided during the interview process.

Developed as part of their take-home test, this project showcases my ability to translate design concepts into a fully functional web application. Every element, from layout to typography, has been implemented to reflect the intended user experience and visual aesthetic.

## Design Decisions

Since Roobert Pro is a paid font, I used Rubik as a close alternative.

I came up with a responsive design that looks good on small screen sizes.

## Future Considerations

I would suggest implementing dark mode for users who prefer a darker color scheme. Since dark mode is a popular feature, it would be a great addition to the website.

## Testing

I used Vitest and React Testing Library for testing.

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Linting

I used ESLint and Prettier to enforce a consistent code style.

To run the linter, use the following command:

```bash
npm run eslint:check # check for linting errors
npm run eslint:fix # fix linting errors
npm run prettier:check # check for formatting errors
npm run prettier:fix # fix formatting errors
```
